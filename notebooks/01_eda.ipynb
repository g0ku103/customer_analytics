    "# Data Cleaning Notes\n",
    "- Initial dataset: 541,909 rows, 8 columns.\n",
    "- Dropped 135,080 rows (~25%) with missing CustomerID, critical for RFM and clustering.\n",
    "- Filled 1,454 missing Descriptions with 'Unknown' for LLM compatibility.\n",
    "- Removed rows with negative Quantity/UnitPrice (likely returns/cancellations).\n",
    "- Created TotalPrice column (Quantity * UnitPrice) for revenue analysis.\n",
    "- Converted CustomerID to string for categorical use.\n",
    "- Fixed SettingWithCopyWarning using .copy() and .loc.\n",
    "- Fixed TypeError by correcting logical operation syntax.\n",
    "- Final shape: 392692 rows, 9 columns.\n",
    "- Saved cleaned data to data/processed/cleaned_data.csv."
